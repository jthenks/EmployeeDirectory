# EmployeeDirectory

This program stores and manipulates an arraylist of employees from a file. The user is able to:
- Print directory contents
- Look up an employee's information
- Create a report with a department phone list
- Change a listing
- Add a listing
- Remove a listing
- Exit (saves the info to file)


This was an old school project. We hadn't yet learned testing and I didn't retroactively add it, but 
this program still showcases useful business procedures.
